A point cloud is a set of data points in space. Point clouds are generally produced by 3D scanners, which measure many points on the external surfaces of
objects around them. A point cloud can be seen as a set of unstructured 3D
points that approximate the geometry of 3D objects. Such realization makes it
a non-Euclidean geometric data representation. However, point clouds can also
be realized as a set of small Euclidean subsets that have a global parametrization and a common system of coordinates and invariant to transformations such
as translation and rotation.
