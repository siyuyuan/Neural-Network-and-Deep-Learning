CIFAR-10 is a widely used dataset for visual recognition task. The CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute For
Advanced Research) is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer
vision algorithms. It is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning research. The CIFAR-10 dataset
contains 60,000 32 × 32 color images in 10 different classes. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds,
cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks (as shown in Figure 1). There are 6,000 images of each class. Since
the images in CIFAR-10 are low-resolution (32 × 32), this dataset can allow us to quickly try our models to see
whether it works.
